Vendor packages area
====================

This area is specifically for:

* Binary blobs that we won't ever modify, and just use (some .debs are used
  to fulfull build time dependencies)

* Source tarballs of tools that are build time dependencies that we'll never
  modify

* Anything binary-blobular that is used in the reference platform that we can
  can redistribute, but don't have any need to modify.
