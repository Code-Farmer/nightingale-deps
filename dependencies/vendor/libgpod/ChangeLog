2006-06-04  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/db-image-parser.c
	  src/itdb_artwork.c
	  src/itdb_device.c
	  src/itdb_photoalbum.c
	  src/itdb_track.c
	  src/ithumb-writer.c: Phased out private
	  IPOD_COVER_SMALL... enum in favor of identical public enum
	  "ItdbThumbType" ITDB_THUMB_COVER_SMALL...

	* src/db-image-parser.c (ipod_image_new_from_mhni):
	  Accept all thumbnail types we know about (i.e. type != -1).

	* src/db-artwork-debug.h
	  src/db-artwork-parser.h
	  src/db-image-parser.h
	  src/db-parse-context.h
	  src/glib-compat.h
	  src/itdb_endianness.h: Added CVS "$Id:" line, added copyright
	  notices where missing, added explanations to itdb_endianess.h
	  ;-)

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c
	  src/itdb_track.c
	  src/itdb_device.c
	  src/itdb_device.h
	  Made naming consistent and suitable for export:
	    Itdb_IpodModel -> Itdb_IpodInfo
	    ipod_model_table -> ipod_info_table
	    itdb_device_get_model_info() -> itdb_device_get_ipod_info()
	    MODEL_TYPE_... -> ITDB_IPOD_MODEL_...
	    nth_GENERATION -> ITDB_IPOD_GENERATION_nth

	  Exported Itdb_IpodModel, Itdb_IpodGeneration, Itdb_IpodInfo,
	  itdb_device_get_ipod_info().

	* src/itdb_device.c: new API:
	  itdb_info_get_ipod_info_table(),
	  itdb_info_get_ipod_model_name()

	* src/itdb.h
	  src/itdb_artwork.c:
	  Removed unused field ->type in Itdb_Artwork and corresponding
	  enum ItdbArtworkType.

2006-06-03  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb_artwork.c (itdb_thumb_get_gdk_pixbuf): handle thumbnail
	  padding correctly -- who would have thought that iTunes
	  indicates _negative_ padding at times... Please use the
	  test-photos program to check out whether or not your photos show
	  up correctly without black bars or funny colors.

        * src/db-artwork-writer.c
	  src/db-image-parser.c
	  src/itdb.h
	  src/ithumb-writer.c: Hopefully do padding right:

	   - read padding fields from mhni header and store them with
	     each thumbnail 
	   - calculate padding for PhotoDB only (padding for iTunesDB
	     Artwork does not seem to be necessary)
	   - include the padding into the total width/height

	   It seems to work well on my iPod Nano -- feedback appreciated.

	* tests/test-photos.c: added possibility to dump all photos into
	  a directory:

	  tests/test-photos dump <mountpoint> <output_dir>

	* src/itdb_artwork.c: changed byte order for full screen iPod
	  Nanos. 

2006-06-01  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/db-artwork-writer.c (write_mhni): fix segfault caused by
	  wrong access of enum inside Itdb_DB

	* src/itdb.h:
	  src/itdb_private.h:
	  moved Itdb_DB to private part.

	* src/itdb.h:
	  src/itdb_private.h:
	  src/itdb_itunesdb:
	  New: db_get_itunesdb(), db_get_photodb()

	* src/db-artwork-parser.c
	  src/db-artwork-writer.c
	  src/db-image-parser.c
	  src/db-image-parser.h
	  src/db-parse-context.c
	  src/db-parse-context.h
	  src/itdb_endianness.h
	  src/itdb_itunesdb.c
	  src/ithumb-writer.c:
	  Remove all direct access to Itdb_DB->db. enum

2006-05-31  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	  m4/python: check for eyeD3 (Todd Zullinger)

2006-05-30  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c (itdb_create_directories): applied
	  Christophe's cleanup-patch, 'normalized' indenting. Function
	  made 'static'.

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c (itdb_init_ipod): fixed segfault.

	* m4/python: default configure option --with_python to 'yes'
	  (Nicholas Piper)

	***** merged photo-support branch back to MAIN. branch is tagged
	      photo-support-merged_00

2006-05-29  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

        * tests/test-photos.c: removed unneeded #include.

	* configure.ac: print configuration summary -- thanks to Todd
	  Zullinger

	* itdb.h:
	  itdb_itunesdb.c:
	  added itdb_init_ipod() -- thanks to P.G. Richardson.

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c (itdb_write_file): only write artwork if
	  supported by the iPod -- thanks to P.G. Richardson.

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c:
	  src/itdb_photoalbum.c:
	  src/itdb_playlist.c:
	
	  fixed some comments so the doc subsystem won't complain.

	* tests/Makefile.am:
	  tests/test-init-ipod.c

	  added new test for itdb_init_ipod(). The test also demonstrates
	  how to 'autodetect' the iPod model number.

	* src/itdb_photoalbum.c:
	  src/ithumb-writer.c:
	  src/itdb_artwork.c:
	  src/itdb.h:
	  src/db-itunes-parser.h:
	  src/db-artwork-writer.c:
	  src/db-artwork-parser.c:
	  src/db-artwork-debug.c:

	  Patch by Michael McLellan:
	  
	  Doesn't automatically make the first photoalbum the
	  'master'. However, if a master already exists it will remain the
	  master.

	  Sets the creation date of a new image to the modification time
	  of the image file.

	  Centers new images.

	  Introduces itdb_photodb_remove_photo().

	
2006-05-29  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb.h:
	  src/itunesdb.c: (Itdb_Track)
	      flag2 -> skip_when_shuffling
	      flag3 -> remember_playback_position

	* src/itunesdb.c: playlist flags 1,2,3 were not read correctly.

2006-05-28  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/db-parse-context.c (db_parse_context_new_from_file):
	  Detect endianess if not already set.

	* src/itdb_device.c (itdb_device_autodetect_endianess): try
	  reading the first for bytes of iTunesDB, ArtworkDB or Photos
	  Database in order to reliably detect the endianess of the
	  connected iPod.

	* src/itdb_photoalbum.c: (itdb_photodb_parse): will fail again if
	  no photos dir is available.

	* tests/test-photos.c: takes into consideration the possibility
	  that an iPod does not have a Photos Database and creates a new
	  one in that case. (I think it's safer that way -- the
	  application is forced to 'think' about the fact that no database
	  is available and either warn the user or create one. If
	  itdb_photodb_parse() simply returns an empty database in case
	  none could be found, the application might not become aware of
	  the fact.)

	* renamed itdb_get_mountpoint_photo to
	  itdb_photodb_get_mountpoint.

	* tests/test-photos.c: added g_error_free()

	* src/itdb_device.c
	  src/itdb_device.h: added number of musicdirs (Fnn dirs) to the
	  model descriptions. The exact number seems to be version
	  dependent. Therefore, the numbers here represent a mixture of
	  reported values and common sense.

2006-05-27  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb_photoalbum.c: itdb_photodb_parse() would fail if no
	  photos dir is available. Quick fix for now (I mean, why
	  SHOULDN'T it fail if no photos dir is available??).

2006-05-26  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb.h:
	  src/itdb_photoalbum.c:
	  src/itdb_artwork.c:
	  Added userdata/usertype fields to Itdb_PhotoDB, Itdb_PhotoAlbum,
	  Itdb_Artwork.

2006-05-25  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

        * Slight cleanup, make PhotoDB API more consistent with iTunesDB
	  API:

	* src/db-artwork-parser.h: declared ipod_write_photo_db() as
	  G_GNUC_INTERNAL

	* src/db-artwork-writer.c (ipod_write_photo_db for non-gdk):
	  Itdb_iTunesDB -> Itdb_PhotoDB

	* src/itdb.h:
	  Itdb_ItunesDB: removed photoalbums and photos.
	  renamed:
	  	 itdb_parse_photo -> itdb_photodb_parse
		 itdb_add_photo_to_photoalbum -> itdb_photodb_add_photo
		 itdb_create_new_photoalbum -> itdb_photodb_photoalbum_new
		 itdb_free_photodb -> itdb_photodb_free
		 itdb_write_photo_db -> itdb_photodb_write
	  new:   itdb_photodb_new()

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c (itdb_parse_photo, itdb_get_photos_dir,
	  itdb_get_photodb_path, itdb_get_photos_thumb_dir): moved to
	  itdb_photoalbum.c

	* src/itdb_photoalbum.c:
	  new:   error_no_photos_dir, itdb_photodb_new, itdb_photodb_write
	  moved: itdb_get_photos_dir, itdb_get_photodb_path,
	         itdb_get_photos_thumb_dir
	  rewrote: 
	         itdb_photodb_parse
	  (itdb_photodb_free): free device struct as well.

	* tests/test-photos.c: change to new API.

	* src/itdb.h: applied Christophe's patch to fix compile time
	  error.

	* po/sv.po: updated Swedish translation (thanks to Stefan
	  Asserhall)

2006-05-20  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* po/POTFILES.in: updated file list -> updated .po files.

2006-05-15  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/db-image-parser.c
	* src/itdb_photoalbum.c
	* src/ithumb-writer.c
	  Michael McLellan patch for photo support on iPod Videos

	  Applied Mikey's second patch for photo support. test-photos now
	  comes with support for photo albums!

2006-05-07  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* Created new branch "photo-support" for testing of photo
	  support. Comes complete with a test program to add photos to
	  your iPod. Works great for me -- thanks to Mikey!

	  --- 2006-05-30: merged back to MAIN.

2006-05-06  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

        * Applied Mikey's patch for photo support.

	* src/itdb_photoalbum.c: new.

	* tests/test-photo.c: test program to add photos to your iPod.

	* Created branch for this patch: 'photo-support'.

2006-05-05  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c: avoid segfault if album field of podcasts
	  is not set (NULL).

        * tests/Makefile.am: removed 'test-rebuild-db' from
	  'noinst_PROGRAM' declaration (bug reported by Jens
	  Taprogge). 'test-rebuild-db' is only added when the taglib is
	  detected.

2006-04-12  Christophe Fergeau  <teuf@gnome.org>

	* tests/test-rebuild-db.cc: forgot to propagate a GError

2006-04-10  Christophe Fergeau  <teuf@gnome.org>

	* tests/test-ls.c: new test program reading and displaying the iPod 
	content 
	* tests/test-rebuild-db.cc: new test program which looks for mp3 files
	on the iPod in the Music dir and rebuild an iPod database from that
	(it uses taglib to parse the tags, so it's conditionnally built
	depending on taglib's availability)
	* configure.ac:
	* tests/Makefile.am: build system changes to accomodate the 2 new test
	programs
	
2006-04-10  Christophe Fergeau  <teuf@gnome.org>

	* src/itdb_device.h: removed dead code
	* src/itdb_playlist.c: make spl_update2 static, kill spl_update

2006-04-08  Christophe Fergeau  <teuf@gnome.org>

	* configure.ac: generate Makefile for bindings/python/examples

2006-04-03  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* itdb.h: flag1 -> has_artwork

	* itdb_track.c: (itdb_track_set_thumbnails,
	  itdb_remove_thumbnails) set has_artwork flag correctly.

2006-04-01  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* itdb.h: unk178 -> mark_unplayed

	* itdb_itunesdb.c: reset the mark_unplayed flag when playcount is
	  detected.

2006-03-31  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

        * po/es.po: replaced with version from Alejandro Lamas who
	  maintains the gtkpod translation as well.

2006-03-29  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

        * itunesdb.c: set filetype identifier when transfering track to
	  the iPod.

2006-03-24  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	Alpha version of reversed-endian Artwork writing. Status: iTunesDB
	can be written and is accepted on mobile phones, ArtworkDB can be
	read and be written as well, but newly added artwork will not yet
	display.

	* itdb.h: adjusted a couple of field lengths (4 byte -> 2 byte or
	  even 1 byte) to address endian issues.

2006-03-18  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* itdb_itunesdb.c (mk_mhod): fixed bug when writing podcast urls.

	* itdb_itunesdb.c (itdb_write_file): move endianess autodetection
	  to a place before calling ipod_write_artwork_db().

2006-03-17  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* itdb_device.[ch]: rewrote ipod-device.c, removed all hal-code,
	  removed all code irrelevant to writing the iTunesDB and
	  ArtworkDB.

	* autodetect iControl directory now also works for ArtworkDB.

	* db-artwork-parser.c (ipod_db_get_artwork_db_path): create
	  Artwork directory if not already present.

	* itdb.h: Itdb_iTunesDB: moved mountpoint and musicdirs into
	  private Itdb_Device. Use itdb_set_mountpoint() and
	  itdb_get_mountpoint() to access the mountpoint.

	* simplified some code by using itdb_get_path() instead of
	  itdb_resolve_path().

	* itdb_itunesdb.c (itdb_get_path): fixed bug.

2006-03-12  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

        * itdb.h, itdb_itunesdb.c: added functions for autodetection of
	  iControl directory (currently either <mp>/iPod_Control or
	  <mp>/iTunes/iTunes_Control): itdb_get_control_dir() and
	  itdb_get_itunes_dir()

2006-02-12  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* itdb.h: added movie_flag and lyrics_flag to Itdb_Track

	* itdb.h, itdb_itunesdb.c, itdb_private.h: added support for
	  mobile phone reversed-endian iTunesDB. Please note that you have
	  to rename the folder iTunes_Control to iPod_Control manually. to
	  write reversed-endian files, itdb->reversed must be set to
	  TRUE. When reading an iTunesDB the endianess is detected
	  automatically and itdb->reversed set appropriately.  Only the
	  inversed iTunesDBs, 'Play Counts', and OTG playlist files are
	  read yet. The ArtworkDB and thumbnail files cannot be parsed
	  yet.

2006-02-04  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* ipod-device.c: added entries for iPod Nano 1 GB black and white
	  (thanks to Leonhard Gruenschlos)

2006-02-04  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac: enable/disable switches for gdk and hal. Thanks to
	  Olivier Cr√™te

	  (ipod_device_get_model_index_from_table): fix warning about
	  unused computed value (thanks to Martin Aumueller)
	
2005-12-18  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

        * src/ipod-device.c: don't ignore return value of

	* src/itdb_artwork.c: (itdb_thumb_get_gdk_pixbuf) allow to get
	  pixbuf even if no iPod is present if the thumbnail points to a
	  local filename. This way artwork support is also possible on the

	  (don't terminate the application just because the ArtworkDB was
	  manipulated).

	* src/db-artwork-writer/parser.c: Create ArtworkDB when it does
	  not exist.

	* src/db-artwork-writer.c, src/itdb_itunesdb.c,
	  src/itdb_track.c, src/ithumb-writer.c: handle artwork size and

2005-11-17  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

        * configure.ac: check for version 2.4 of glib -- now we need to

2005-11-15  Christophe Fergeau  <teuf@gnome.org>

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c: (itdb_new): initialise glib type system before

2005-11-11  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c: (itdb_set_mountpoint) do not call

	* src/itdb.h src/itdb_itunesdb.c: change API for
	  itdb_shuffle_write() to be identical to itdb_itunesdb_write()

2005-11-08  Christophe Fergeau  <teuf@gnome.org>

	* configure.ac: fixed hal detection, stole a bit more autoconf-fu from 
	libipoddevice so that ipod-device.c compiles when hal is detected

2005-11-08  Christophe Fergeau  <teuf@gnome.org>

	* src/hal-common.c:
	* src/hal-common.h: more #if => #ifdef changes

	* src/hal-common.h:
	* src/ipod-device.c: (ipod_device_set_property),
	(ipod_device_hal_initialize), (ipod_device_detect_volume_info),
	(ipod_device_new), (ipod_device_eject): sync with libipoddevice CVS,
	use #ifdef HAVE_LIBHAL instead of #if HAVE_LIBHAL

2005-11-06  Christophe Fergeau  <teuf@gnome.org>

	* src/ipod-device.h:
	* src/itdb.h: added missing G_BEGIN_DECLS and G_END_DECLS

2005-11-05  Christophe Fergeau  <teuf@gnome.org>

	* src/itdb_track.c: (is_video_ipod), (itdb_track_set_defaults): deal

	current track must be shown in the video or audio menu or both)

2005-11-05  Christophe Fergeau  <teuf@gnome.org>

	* src/ipod-device.c: (ipod_device_get_property),
	(ipod_device_class_init):
	* src/ipod-device.h: sync with libipoddevice CVS to get information

	element to Itdb_iTunesDB. This makes it possible for libgpod to know
	the type (regular/nano/mini/video/...) of the iPod it's currently 
	dealing with (which is necessary for proper cover art support for 
	example)

2005-11-04  Christophe Fergeau  <teuf@gnome.org>

	* src/Makefile.am: db-itunes-parser.h was missing from the source file
	list, this made "make dist" generate uncompilable tarballs

2005-11-04  Christophe Fergeau  <teuf@gnome.org>

	* autogen.sh: add missing call to glib-gettextize, this has the nice

	* configure.ac:
	* src/db-artwork-writer.c: (ipod_buffer_grow_mapping),

	  before calling ipod_pars_artwork_db()

	* db-artwork_parser.c (ipod_parse_artwork_db): added assertion
          to avoid segfault if called NULL parameter.

	* itdb_itunesdb.c (get_mhip): fixed handling for iTunesDB
          versions 4.7 and smaller.

2005-10-24  Christophe Fergeau  <teuf@gnome.org>

	  at least up to 0.14.4.

	* TROUBLESHOOTING: added tips for missing ./mkinstalldirs and
	  po/Makefile.in.in

2005-10-17  Christophe Fergeau  <teuf@gnome.org>

	* src/db-image-parser.c: (get_pixel_data),
	(ipod_image_new_from_mhni):
	* src/itdb.h:

	in the ItdbImage structures so that they match what they are in the
	database on the iPod.

2005-10-15  Jorg Schuler <jcsjcs at users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c,itdb_private.h: fixes for 64 bit systems

2005-10-11  Christophe Fergeau  <teuf@gnome.org>

	* src/itdb_itunesdb.c: (get_mhip): added missing parameter to
	a g_warning call, this broke compilation on FC4
