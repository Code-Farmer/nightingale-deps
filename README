Nightingale is a community based fork of the Songbird Web/Media player
distributed under the GNU GPL and portions (xulrunner and mozilla libs)
licensed under the Mozilla MPL/BSD license. 

This is what's left of the needed dependencies (just xulrunner) 
for Nightingale. Other libs should come from the distro's own libraries.
Hopefully, in the future, this won't be necessary and we'll be able
to build against the system xulrunner.
