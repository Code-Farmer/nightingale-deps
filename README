Nightingale Build Dependencies
================================

This repo is based on the SVN dependencies from Songbird. Currently,
this repo only works 100% for sure with Linux. Linux only requires the
sqlite, taglib, and xulrunner dependencies.

Right now, both debug and release versions of these three dependencies 
will be built, in the future build.sh will allow you to choose.

Building
================================

To build, simply run build.sh if on Linux. Mac and Windows support coming
soon.
